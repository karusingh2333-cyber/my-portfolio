# My Video Editing Portfolio

This is a simple static portfolio for video editing and motion work — built as a single `index.html` file so it's easy to host on GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Replace `VIDEO_ID`, `VIDEO_ID_1`, `VIDEO_ID_2`, `VIDEO_ID_3` in `index.html` with your YouTube video IDs (upload videos as *Unlisted* if you don't want them public on your channel).
2. Replace contact links & email.
3. Commit changes and enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → main branch → root).
4. Live site: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
